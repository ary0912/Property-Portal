# Getting Into The Project:-

Property Portal is a team project made by me and my friends during a Hackathon we participated in. We made this portal in 24 hours includig the time to decide the problmw statement and how will the protal will work. The project is an online platform designed to revolutionize the way property transactions are conducted. By removing the need for middlemen such as brokers and agents, the platform provides a more direct, cost-effective, and secure means of buying and selling properties. Users can create an account on the platform after undergoing a thorough verification process. To sell a property, the user is required to fill out a form providing all the necessary details. The government officials then verifies the information and approves the sale request. All money transfers are processed through the platform, ensuring transparency and security. By leveraging the power of technology and eliminating intermediaries, the platform offers a fast, reliable, and efficient way to conduct property transactions.
